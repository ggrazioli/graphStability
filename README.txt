The purpose of these R codes is to provide publicly available code for calculating
one step stable regions in parameter space for network models, as per the work
described in the article titled:
"Local Graph Stability in Exponential Family Random Graph Models"
by Yue Yu, Gianmarc Grazioli, Nolan E. Phillips, and Carter T. Butts
https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.09470 (This link will be updated)

The example used in the sample application (sampleRunScript.R) is a network 
describing a network topology, which has been observed in amyloid fibrils, called 
a 2-ribbon. For details on the significance of this fibril topology, please 
see the article titled: Network-Based Classification and Modeling of Amyloid Fibrils
by Gianmarc Grazioli, Yue Yu, Megha H. Unhelkar, Rachel W. Martin, and Carter T. Butts

This code was written by Gianmarc Grazioli.
